# MemeBuilderPrivacyPolicy
This repository is used to maintain the privacy policy for the Meme Builder Android application.

PRIVACY POLICY

Information and data provided by the user (in the form of images for creating meme images) is owned by and is exclusively accessible by the app user. Meme images created through the application are stored locally on the users machine. Meme Builder accesses local user storage for image files but the app does not have a means of accessing such files by the developers or anyone other than the user. 

If a user chooses to share a meme they have created to another platform (such as Facebook or Reddit), such files are shared via the built in Android share intent and are thus properly encrypted during their transmission. 

At this time Meme Builder contains no additional services or functionality for collecting or accessing additional user information beyond local storage for accessing local user images. 

Effective date: 3.13.2017
